               <h4><span> Humanity’s Greatest Opportunities</span></h4> 
                    The affordable housing crisis is one of humanity’s greatest challenges, but Reall also approaches solutions to the housing crisis as one of our greatest opportunities. Enabling families to access green, safe affordable housing offers more than simply shelter. It creates an intergenerational economic and social asset which has the potential to break the poverty cycle for good.
                    
                    Affordable and climate smart housing also brings a wealth of wider benefits, for example every house built creates five new jobs unlocking an untapped $17 trillion global market.

                    <span>How we’re building homes that don’t cost the earth</span>
  The climate crisis is a threat to which the world’s urban poor are particularly vulnerable. The affordable housing deficit must be addressed in a rapidly scalable and environmentally viable way to achieve the systemic change needed by 2050.
  
  Disrupting the housing market, through the delivery of affordable homes, has the ability to increase access to clean energy, support the transition to clean forms of transport, and direct finance 
  flows to low carbon assets – all while dramatically improving the lives of those in urban Africa and Asia.
